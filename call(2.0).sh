#it worked for me, b/c I typed this in the command prompt, but I don't know if the change is permanent or if it would need to be done again when used in a separate terminal. So, I am resubmitting this file with the command built into the script just in case the first file doesn't work.

chmod+x call.sh 

python counter.py *.txt
